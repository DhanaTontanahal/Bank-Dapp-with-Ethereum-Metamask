In this repo, we are creating a smart contract using Remix IDE and then deploying it to Rinkeby Test Network (Ethereum Block Chain) .

Before deploying to Ethereum Block chain's test network , we tested the smart contract with Javascript VM in Remix IDE.

We are configuring the Remix IDE ( #https://remix.ethereum.org/)  Environment value in the Deploy Section to Injected Web3, which gets connected to MetaMask
and inturn Meta mask acts as a bridge between the Remix IDE and Ethereum network.

We also deposited some ether by following instructions at 
#https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet.

Please kase sure you send the address present on the Account displayed when you open it.

Once you get Ether, which is used to do any transaction on the Block chain.

We also created a Front End , we are using the ethereum javascript API to call the methods or functions which we have written in the 
Smart Contract deployed to Test Network.

When we triggger any transaction, the transaction details are passsed on to Metamask and then to the test network.

The transaction gets created on the network , after the block is assigned , mined and smart contract program is executed to basically mutate
the state of the block or data.

Once the transaction is completed , you can cross check the status in the Metamask UI or also on EtherScan website by submitting the 
transaction hash.

Check below screenshots for understanding.
